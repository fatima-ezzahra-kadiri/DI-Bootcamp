    "> To build this model, several categories of data are required, including personal and socio-economic details such as age, gender, marital status, number of dependents, employment status, income level, and region of residence, as these variables help estimte financial stability and repayment capacity. Additional fiancial and credit data such as credit scores, existing debts, monthly financial obligations, and if available, bank account history, are essential to evaluate creditworthiness and financial discipline. Loan specific attributes, including loan amount, duration, interest rate, and loan purpose, further influence the risk assiciated with the credit request. Finally, repayment history, including past late payments, or previous defaults, provides one of the strongest predictors of future repayment behavior.\n",

The institution must comply with privacy and data protection regulations, such as CNDP guidelines and general rules governing personnaly indentifiable information. Potnetial challenges include data quality issues, missing or inconsistent values, biased historical decisions that may unintentionally propagate discrimination, and sampling bias that could distort the model's predictions. strong data governance is therefore essential, ensuring secure storage, restricted access, anonymization where appropriate, and ethical handling of sensitive data throughout the entire model lifecycle."

    "> For the loan default prediction task, I would choose Logistic Regression and Random Forest as candidate models. Logistic Regression is suitable because it provides interpretable coefficients and performs well on binary classification problems with structured data. Random Forest is also appropriate because it captures non-linear relationships, handles mixed feature types, and is robust to noise and missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To evaluate the models, I would first split the dataset into training and test sets using a stratified split to preserve the proportion of default vs. non-default cases. I would then apply cross-validation, such as 5-fold stratified cross-validation, to obtain stable performance estimates. The main metrics I would report are recall, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and the confusion matrix, since predicting defaults is a high-risk decision. I would also tune and interpret the decision threshold by analyzing the precision-recall tradeoff to reduce false negatives, which are costly in loan approval scenarios.\n",

    "#### Supervised Learning Model (Classification)\n",
    "> To evaluate a supervised classification model, I would begin by splitting the data into training and test sets and applying cross-validation to ensure stable performance across folds. I would report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to capture both overall correctness and class-specific performance, and I would plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC to evaluate ranking quality. I would also examine the confusion matrix to identify systematic classification errors. A key challenge in evaluating supervised models is dealing with class imbalance, which can make accuracy misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning Model (Clustering)\n",
    ">To assess an unsupervised clustering model, I would measure cluster structure using metrics such as the silhouette score to quantify separation and cohesion. I would also use the elbow method to inspect how the within-cluster variance changes with different numbers of clusters and rely on diagnostic plots like silhouette diagrams or inertia curves to visually judge cluster quality. If ground truth labels exist, I could additionally compute adjusted Rand index or mutual information. A major challenge in evaluating unsupervised models is the absence of true labels, which makes objective evaluation difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning Model\n",
    ">To evaluate a reinforcement learning model, I would track cumulative reward over episodes to measure how effectively the agent learns to maximize long-term returns. I would check for convergence by observing whether the learning curve stabilizes and ensure an appropriate exploration–exploitation balance by monitoring how often the agent explores new actions versus exploiting known profitable ones. I would also test the learned policy in multiple environments or seeds to ensure stability and robustness. A key challenge in evaluating reinforcement learning models is that performance can vary widely depending on stochastic environments and exploration behavior."
